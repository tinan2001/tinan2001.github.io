    "text": "This project examined the land cover and land use (LCLU) changes between 2010 – 2024 in Amherst, New York. Additionally, since Amherst hosts multiple academic campuses– such as the University at Buffalo’s (UB) North Campus, the study looked at any evidence of physical changes resulting from studentification. The study found that there was an increase in residential land use supporting the overall Town’s population growth. The study also identified the majority of apartment land use change occurring within a two-mile radius of the university campus, which supports the University’s increase student population along with the physical land use changes corresponding with the studentification process"

    "text": "Introduction\nEastern Hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) are native to eastern United State forests. Categorized as a foundation species, Eastern hemlocks play an important part in the local ecosystem by altering soil chemistry, ground temperature and hydraulic processes (Ford & Vose, 2007; Martin & Goebel, 2013). Due to the invasive species, Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelfes tsugae) (HWA), Eastern Hemlocks have also been categorized as a near threatened species. With the lack of predators and bio resilience in the North American region, HWA area able to relentlesslt feed on eastern hemlock tree sap causing plant tissue damage- amplifying the plant’s stress and morality rate. On its own, HWA infestation is not the singular cause for hemlock mortality. Infected hemlock mortality increase in conjunction with other environmental songstress such as limited or excessive soil moisture and increased sunlight exposure (Sivaramakrishnan, n.d.).\nProblem\nCurrently, HWA spread is limited by cold winter temperatures. With ongoing climate change, cold periods are less intense- allowing HWA dispersion north (Cornelsen, n.d.). HWA movement into newer regions will require expensive management and monitoring. These management plans are likely to be multi-year efforts (Blossey, 1999; Keller et al., 2011). To help reduce the cost, risk assessment models can be created to predict regions within an area of concern that may have higher HWA invested hemlock mortality. Risk assessment models allow for limited managing resources to be utilized effectively and efficiently.\nStudy Area The study area for this problem was Franklin Gulf County Park in North Collins, New York. The park is geographically and hydrologically diverse with features such as ravines, streams, and waterfalls. The woody species located in this area mainly consist of Beech, Hickories, and Eastern Hemlocks.\nMethods To create a risk assessment map to showcase which areas are more likely to have higher invested hemlock mortality, elevation, soil, and hemlock presence is required.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary (kableExtra)\nlibrary (knitr)\n\nsource_data&lt;- data.frame( data_source = c('USGS DEM', 'USDA SSURGO', 'Sentinel-2', 'NYS Digital Orthoimagery Program'),\n                          data_type = c('elevation, slope, and streams', 'soil drainage characteristics', '10 meter remote sensing images (April 2018 and 2022)', '1 meter remote sensing images from 2021'))"

Areas where agricultural land use changed from bare soil to vegetation cover, due to harvesting, significantly affected multiple accuracy metrics.

All Landsat and Sentinel images were initially classified into four land cover categories: Water, Building, Road, and Vegetation. Due to the large spatial resolution of Landsat products, the building and road classes were later merged into a single urban surface class to conduct a change analysis. Training samples were placed throughout the entire study area– with a minimum of 2,000 Landsat training pixels and 50,000 Sentinel training pixels. Due to the absence of accuracy assessments, higher quantities of training pixels were required for the 2010 and 2015 Landsat images with 9,776 and 5,686 total pixels, respectively. The 2017, 2020, and 2024 Landsat images were classified based on how well their results were during their accuracy assessments with the classified Sentinel images. After analyzing areas with inconsistent classifications, pixels classified as building or road were merged into one single urban surface class, to help the accuracy metrics using RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Polygons Utilizing ArcGIS Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Sample Pixels For Each Raster Image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial pixel classifications was water (0), buildings (1), roads (2), vegetation (3)"

Four-class confusion matrices were created using randomly selected pixels within the study site. Each class had relatively similar randomly selected pixel counts within each year assessed. In 2017, 2020, and 2024, each class had between 400 – 450, 830 – 960, and 750 – 965 pixels, respectively. User Accuracy (UA), Producer Accuracy (PA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa Score were all derived from the resulting confusion matrices. After assessing the accuracy measurements, the building and road classes were combined into a single urban surface class, to address challenges arising from the 30m2 Landsat spatial resolution such as the poor edge detection in residential neighborhoods. The four-class confusion matrices were then updated to three-class confusion matrices and corresponding accuracies metrics were updated accordingly.\n\n\nInitial four-class accuracy assessments\n\n\n\nThree-class accuracy assessments"

A local analysis was performed using a focal 5×5 pixel moving window to identify hotspots of vegetation-to-urban surface change. Hotspots were defined as areas where at least 15 out of the 25 neighboring pixels within the window indicated vegetation-to urban surface change. After each hotspot was identified, the land use was manually assigned using Google Maps. Land use analysis was carried out for the entire study area. To investigate any correlation between land use change and University at Buffalo’s student population dynamics, a two-mile buffer was placed around UB’s North Campus. Land use hotspots, within this two-mile buffer, were later compared to the overall land use classification and the land use located outside the buffer.\nLoad necessary packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(sp)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(dbscan)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(osmdata)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\nlibrary(prettymapr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\n\nImport classified land raster files and Amherst, NY town boundary\n\n\nCode\nr10 &lt;- rast(\"GEO653_documents/Amherst_2010.tif\") \nr15 &lt;- rast(\"GEO653_documents/Amherst_2015.tif\") \nr17 &lt;- rast(\"GEO653_documents/Amherst_2017.tif\") \nr20 &lt;- rast(\"GEO653_documents/Amherst_2020.tif\") \nr24 &lt;- rast(\"GEO653_documents/Amherst_2024.tif\") \n\namherst &lt;- vect(\"GEO653_documents/BB.shp\")\n\n\n\nReproject variables and clean up the data\n\n\nCode\namherst &lt;- project(amherst, crs(r17))\namherst_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(amherst)\n\n#crop boundaries\nclip_raster &lt;- function(r, boundary) \n                                          {mask (crop (r, boundary[2, ]), boundary)}\n\nr10 &lt;- clip_raster(r10, amherst)\nr15 &lt;- clip_raster(r15, amherst)\nr17 &lt;- clip_raster(r17, amherst)\nr20 &lt;- clip_raster(r20, amherst)\nr24 &lt;- clip_raster(r24, amherst)\n\n\nrcl &lt;- matrix(c(\n  10, 1,\n  20, 2,\n  30, 3,\n  60, 4\n), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n\n\nr10_reclass &lt;- classify(r10, rcl)\nr15_reclass &lt;- classify(r15, rcl)\nr17_reclass &lt;- classify(r17, rcl)\nr20_reclass &lt;- classify(r20, rcl)\nr24_reclass &lt;- classify(r24, rcl)\n\nr10_aligned &lt;- r10_reclass\nr15_aligned &lt;- resample(r15_reclass, r10_reclass, method = \"near\")\nr17_aligned &lt;- resample(r17_reclass, r10_reclass, method = \"near\")\nr20_aligned &lt;- resample(r20_reclass, r10_reclass, method = \"near\")\nr24_aligned &lt;- resample(r24_reclass, r10_reclass, method = \"near\")\n\nr10_aligned[r10_aligned == 255] &lt;- NA\nr15_aligned[r15_aligned == 255] &lt;- NA\nr17_aligned[r17_aligned == 255] &lt;- NA\nr20_aligned[r20_aligned == 255] &lt;- NA\nr24_aligned[r24_aligned == 255] &lt;- NA\n\n\nPlot to show areas that changed from vegetation to developed urban between different years\n\n\nCode\npar(mfrow = c(1, 3), oma = c(0, 0, 4, 0)) \n\nveg_to_dev_10_15 &lt;- (r10_aligned %in% c(0,3)) & (r15_aligned %in% c(1,2))\nplot(veg_to_dev_10_15, main = \"2010 - 2015\")\n\nveg_to_dev_15_17 &lt;- (r15_aligned %in% c(0,3)) & (r17_aligned %in% c(1,2))\nplot(veg_to_dev_15_17, main = \"2015 - 2017\")\n\nveg_to_dev_17_20 &lt;- (r17_aligned %in% c(0,3)) & (r20_aligned %in% c(1,2))\nplot(veg_to_dev_17_20, main = \"2017 - 2020\")\n\nmtext(\"Areas of Vegetation to Developed\",\n      outer = TRUE, cex = 1.5, line = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change analysis will use 2010-2024\n\n\nCode\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 4, 0)) \nveg_to_dev_10_24 &lt;- (r10_aligned %in% c(0,3)) & (r24_aligned %in% c(1,2))\nplot(veg_to_dev_10_24, main = \"2010 - 2024\")\n\nveg_to_dev_17_24 &lt;- (r17_aligned %in% c(0,3)) & (r24_aligned %in% c(1,2))\n#plot(veg_to_dev_17_24, main = \"2017 - 2024\")\n\nveg_to_dev_20_24 &lt;- (r20_aligned %in% c(0,3)) & (r24_aligned %in% c(1,2))\n#plot(veg_to_dev_20_24, main = \"2020 - 2024\")\n\nmtext(\"Areas of Vegetation to Developed\",\n      outer = TRUE, cex = 1.5, line = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind spatial clustering of land change (‘True’ cells)\n\n\nCode\nmoving_window &lt;- matrix(1, 5, 5)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nveg_loss_hotspots_10_24 &lt;- focal(veg_to_dev_10_24, w = moving_window, fun = sum, na.policy = \"omit\")\nplot(veg_loss_hotspots_10_24, main = \"Vegetation to Development Hotspots 2010 - 2024\", col = terrain.colors(170))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nstrong_hotspots_10_24&lt;- veg_loss_hotspots_10_24 &gt; 15\nplot(strong_hotspots_10_24, main = \"Strong Vegetation Loss Hotspots 2010 - 2024\", col = c(\"white\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nn_hotspot_pixels_10_24 &lt;- global(strong_hotspots_10_24, sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nhotspot_area_m2_10_24 &lt;- n_hotspot_pixels_10_24 * 900\n\ncat(sprintf(\"There is a total of %.2f m² of hotspots identified.\\n\", hotspot_area_m2_10_24))\n\n\nThere is a total of 953100.00 m² of hotspots identified.\n\n\nAfter identifying the hotspot areas, convert the raster pixels into polygons and calculate the centroid of each polygon.

    "text": "Land Use Change Near University at Buffalo’s North Campus\nA proximity analysis was conducted after applying a two-mile buffer around the University at Buffalo’s North Campus. Of the 27 vegetation-to-urban surface hotspots identified within the study area, 14 hotspots were located within the two-mile buffer zone. Most of these hotspots, inside the buffer, were classified as apartments (7 out of 8 total apartment hotspots), suggesting that the apartment developments, within the buffer, are likely oriented towards university students. In contrast, the majority of residential hotspots (10 out of 11) were located outside the buffer, suggesting that these areas are oriented towards local residents. The addition of the seven student-oriented apartments, near the campus, reflects the physical changes associated with studentification (Smith, 2004). As more developments are catered towards the seasonal student population, it is likely that these areas experience fluctuations in activity- becoming quieter and empty during academic breaks and busier with increased traffic and noise during the academic season. Additionally, University at Buffalo’s enrollment data, from 2010 – 2024, showed an increase in student enrollments between 2010 – 2020, which may have contributed to the rise in apartment buildings. However, the enrollment decline from 2020 – 2024, could further enhance the sense of emptiness in these student-focused areas during academic breaks (Kinton et al., 2018; Sage et al., 2012)."
